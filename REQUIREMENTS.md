**Trait:** The characteristics associated with a Deathbat.

**Twin:** Two Deathbats with the most alike traits.

**1/1:** One of One, a truly unique Deathbat that deviates from the standard image and traits and therefore has no twin.

## Functional

**FR01.** The user shall be able to enter a source Deathbat number.

**FR02.** The source Deathbat image shall be displayed.

**FR03.** Deathbat traits shall be displayed along with any Deathbat images. (TODO)

**FR04.** The source Deathbat traits shall be compared against all Deathbat traits to find their twin.

**FR05.** 1/1 Deathbats shall be determined not to have a twin.

**FR06.** The Deathbat twin shall be displayed.

**FR07.** Current Deathbat owners shall be displayed along with any Deathbat image.

**FR10.** Deathbat numbers shall be displayed along with any Deathbat images.

## Performance
